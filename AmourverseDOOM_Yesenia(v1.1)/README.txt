---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone, and welcome to my first ever Doom Classic mod!

In this mod, you can play as an adorable, yet very deadly and trigger-happy Mimikyu girl named Yesenia. As this cutie, you must gather up your toys, raid through the forces of hell to find a way to return to your family unit of bandits, the Ravagers.

All weapons had designs based on Pokemon, with both fire and alt-fire modes implemented. Feel free to guess them all.While the game is now playable, there will be some aesthetical updates to perhaps enhance the experience (and learn new aspects of the engine) in due time.

NOTE: If there's any bugs, glitches or suggestions you wanne tell me, lemme know in the comments.

-------------|Moves|--------------
These are the additional moves you have at your disposal:

-Kick: You can kick your enemies when you're cornered. Default: Q.-Slide: You can slide under gaps, if you need to keep your momentum. Default: F

-Slide: You can slide under gaps, if you need to keep your momentum. Default: F

-Slide Kick: You can also perform a slightly stronger kick while you slide. Press Kick while sliding.

-Double Jump: You can take an extra leap in the air. Nothing too fancy.-Ledge Grab: You can grab onto ledges, another simple need.

-Ledge Grab: You can grab onto ledges, another simple need.

-Ground Slam: You can slam the grown for a brief shockwave of damage around you. Do this while on a high place to execute a much powerful shockwave! Default: G

-------------|Weapons|------------

Buster Pistol: This is your standard little peashooter Lucky gave you... in case you overuse the Ultra Beam. Sharpsaw: A modified chainsaw weapon that you can swing it like a sword with the Alt-Fire. 

Sluggershard: A shotgun-type weapon that shoots ice shards at your enemies. With Alt-fire, you can increase the amount of shards and spread it shoots. 

Quadbuck: Another shotgun-type weapon that shoots water shots at jet speeds at a lesser spread than its ice counterpart. Alt-fire makes the gun shoot four shots at the same time for more damage. 

Siege Turret: A minigun-type weapon that fires iron shots at a rapid rate. Using its Alt-Fire will activate its Siege mode and shoot even more rapidly in a spread, perfect for clearing house. 

Clam Launcher: This whopper of a weapon shoots explosive and bouncy clams forward, that once rested will detonate in a violent, concentrated liquid burst. It's Alt-Fire shoots clams without the shell, turning them into sticky explosives that you can shoot to detonate. 

FERRA Buster Prototype: A beam-type weapon based on an old model for what seemed like an... android... cyborg? It shoots light lasers at your enemies, and its Alt-Fire lets your prepare a charged shot that leaves a small explosion upon impact. 

Ultra Beam: Lucky calls them the "Proton Disruptor Cannons", Yesenia calls them the "Happy Boomers", we keep arguing how we call these. All we know is that they shoot bursts of Proton energy that detonate upon impact. And when its Alt-Fire is used, it charges up and uses plenty of it's capacity to shoot a massive, destructive ultra beam that deals loads of damage. Hence its current nickname here "Ultra Beam". 

-------------|Powerups|---------------

Ghost Gem: This lets you gain berserker's strength, enhancing your scarf arms and kicks by a lot! Heavy Duty Boots: These let you walks on sludge or harmful surfaces without hurting your feet. 

Phase Cloth: It's a piece cloth that cloaks your from enemy sight. Thermal Scope Lens: These let you see in infrared, good for trekking in the dark. 

Rare Candy: You don't see these often around. They will grant you a big boost of health. 

Ink Sphere: Raven's ink contained in a ball. Getting this will imbue your body and jacket with ink, granting you a massive bonus of heals and armor. 

Map Module: A device that you can access to download the current amp's full layout. 

Mimikyum Z: The most powerful item in the run (for a Mimikyu at least). Strength, speed, invulnerability, infinite ammo... this item will make you a goddess for a minute, so use that time in your favor.
